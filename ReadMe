Please note that this code is not representative of my current coding style. 

Name:		Ethan Ford

RedID:		XXXXXXXXX

Semester:	Fall 2016

Instructions:	
      "a" moves the character left.
		  "s" moves the character right.
		  Space is jump.
		  Left-Click where you want to shoot your block.
		  Shooting a block will cost you 1/3 or your health.
		  Note: if a spear hits your block, the block will disappear.
		  Hint for level 3: going over one of the "bounce blocks" 
    will activate a deactivaded bounce block (the one with 
    the coin over it).

Issues/Bugs:	The block will not always "stick" where you want it.
		  If a horizontal spear hits you while you're on the ground, it 
    wont knock you back.
		  Sometimes you don't "stick" to a moving platform.
		  Sometimes the bounce block will shoot you with an enormous amount 
    of force. (I do not know why, I've spent hours trying to find 
    out why)
		  Same thing goes for the water blocks.
		  Lastly, if you want the main menu to sit correctly in frame I 
    suggest running it at 1920x1080
